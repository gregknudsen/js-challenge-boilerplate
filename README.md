## Dev Notes

- I did make an assumption that the 4th value in the `sample.csv` file was supposed to be `457508000` rather than `45750800`. This followed the examples in the PDF instructions provided by Kin.
- Testing: This is a known weakness for me and is certainly something I would "level up" prior to assuming any position with Kin.
- Thanks for the opportunity!
